Problems faced and thoughts when practicing spark:
1. spark command will use Java lib, so it is necessary to install Java/JDK before running spark.
2. popular tools when using spark: intellij scala spark sbt
when I want to use sbt, scala, spark with Intellij, I faced "download" error, maybe it is because the version incompability.
